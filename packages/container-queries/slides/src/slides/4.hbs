        <h2>OpenAPI</h2>
      </div>
      <p>The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a <u>standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs</u>
        which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access
        to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection.</p>
      <p>When properly defined, a consumer can <u>understand</u> and <u>interact</u> with the remote service
        with a <u>minimal amount of implementation logic</u>.</p>
